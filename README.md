# OWASP-10-A04-insecure-design-III

## **1\. Brief Summary**

This repository serves as a practical lab focusing on the functionality of fuzzers for security testing, specifically demonstrating the use of **SharpFuzz** within a .NET environment. The project explores the challenges and approaches to fuzzing .NET applications, including console applications and REST APIs, building upon insights gained from working with fuzzers like American Fuzzy Lop (AFL++) and WuppieFuzz. The primary goal is to understand how to apply code-driven fuzzing for identifying vulnerabilities, particularly in the context of managed languages.

## **2\. Lessons Learned**

Based on the practical experience documented, here are the key takeaways regarding fuzzers and their application:

* **Language Focus**: Many open-source fuzzers, such as AFL and AFL++, are primarily designed for C and C++ projects, focusing on memory-corruption vulnerabilities. This necessitates the use of wrappers or specialized fuzzers for managed languages like C\# or Java.  
* **Wrapper Ecosystem**: There's a significant ecosystem of wrappers (e.g., SharpFuzz for .NET) that adapt the core functionality of established fuzzers to specific languages and frameworks.  
* **Narrow Scope**: Fuzzers like SharpFuzz are most effective when applied to small, isolated pieces of code (e.g., static classes, utility functions) that can process varied inputs without extensive configuration or external dependencies.  
* **Input Guidance**: The quality and structure of the initial input (corpus) are crucial. Well-crafted inputs can significantly guide the fuzzing process, influencing success rates and execution timings.  
* **Instrumentation Importance**: Advanced fuzzing often involves instrumentation, which allows for fine-tuning and directing the fuzzing process to achieve better code coverage and bug detection. This can be complex but is highly beneficial for thorough testing.  
* **Time Investment vs. Long-Term Benefit**: Fuzzing requires a considerable initial investment in understanding, configuration, and instrumentation. However, in the long term, it offers significant benefits, especially when integrated into automated pipelines (e.g., CI/CD) for continuous security testing.  
* **API Fuzzing Workaround**: For fuzzing REST APIs, a practical workaround involves running the API host in parallel and configuring the fuzzer's console program to act as an HTTP client, sending fuzzed requests to the running API.  
* **Exception Handling**: Standard exception handling middleware in frameworks can prevent fuzzers from reporting crashes, as they often look for program termination. Modifying the fuzzer's target code to re-throw or specifically catch and re-trigger crashes can be necessary.

## **3\. Code Examples**

### **Console Program (owasp10.A04.fuzzer/Program.cs)**

This example demonstrates a typical structure for a SharpFuzz console application. The Fuzz.Run method takes a Stream as input, which is automatically provided by the fuzzer with generated test cases. The application then processes this stream, often attempting operations that might expose vulnerabilities (e.g., deserialization, file path manipulation, or API calls).

using System;  
using System.IO;  
using SharpFuzz;  
using System.Text.Json;  
using System.Net.Http;  
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace owasp10.A04.fuzzer  
{  
    public class Program  
    {  
        public static void Main(string\[\] args)  
        {  
            // Fuzz.Run expects a Func\<Stream, bool\> or Action\<Stream\>  
            // The stream contains the fuzzed input.  
            Fuzz.Run(stream \=\>  
            {  
                try  
                {  
                    // Example 1: Fuzzing JSON Deserialization  
                    // This attempts to deserialize the fuzzed input as JSON.  
                    // Any parsing errors or unexpected behavior would be reported.  
                    using (var reader \= new StreamReader(stream))  
                    {  
                        var jsonString \= reader.ReadToEnd();  
                        // Console.WriteLine($"Fuzzing JsonSerializer with: {jsonString}"); // For debugging  
                        JsonSerializer.Deserialize\<object\>(jsonString);  
                    }

                    // Example 2: Fuzzing Path manipulation  
                    // This attempts to create a path from the fuzzed input.  
                    // Malformed paths or unexpected exceptions could be reported.  
                    stream.Position \= 0; // Reset stream for the next test  
                    using (var reader \= new StreamReader(stream))  
                    {  
                        var pathString \= reader.ReadToEnd();  
                        // Console.WriteLine($"Fuzzing Path with: {pathString}"); // For debugging  
                        Path.GetFullPath(pathString);  
                    }

                    // Example 3: Fuzzing a REST API (OwaspWebApi \- SQLi project)  
                    // For this to work, the OwaspWebApi needs to be running in parallel.  
                    // The fuzzer will generate input, which is then used to construct an HTTP request.  
                    stream.Position \= 0; // Reset stream for the next test  
                    using (var reader \= new StreamReader(stream))  
                    {  
                        var fuzzedInput \= reader.ReadToEnd();  
                        // In a real scenario, you'd construct a malicious payload using fuzzedInput  
                        // and send it to your running API. For example, injecting it into a query parameter.

                        // This is a simplified representation. In a full implementation,  
                        // you would parse the fuzzedInput to generate various API payloads.  
                        // For instance, if fuzzedInput is "1 OR 1=1", you'd inject it into a URL.

                        // Example: Fuzzing a SQLi vulnerable endpoint  
                        // Note: This requires the API to be running separately.  
                        // The actual interaction logic would be more complex, involving HTTPClient.  
                        // For demonstration, we'll simulate a call that might trigger an ORM exception.  
                        // In a real fuzzer, you'd make an actual HTTP request and check the response/logs.

                        // Placeholder for API interaction logic  
                        // If the fuzzedInput causes an SQLi, the ORM (sqlite-net in the article)  
                        // would throw an exception, which SharpFuzz would then report.  
                        if (fuzzedInput.Contains("OR 1=1") || fuzzedInput.Contains("UNION SELECT"))  
                        {  
                            // Simulate an ORM exception for demonstration purposes  
                            // In a real scenario, this would be an actual exception from an API call  
                            throw new InvalidOperationException($"Simulated ORM exception due to fuzzed input: {fuzzedInput}");  
                        }  
                    }  
                }  
                catch (Exception ex)  
                {  
                    // SharpFuzz will report crashes when unhandled exceptions occur.  
                    // For specific cases (like API fuzzing with middleware), you might  
                    // need to catch a specific exception and re-throw a different one  
                    // to ensure SharpFuzz registers it as a crash.  
                    Console.Error.WriteLine($"Fuzzer caught an exception: {ex.Message}");  
                    throw; // Re-throw to ensure SharpFuzz captures the crash  
                }  
                return true; // Return true to continue fuzzing  
            });  
        }  
    }  
}
